# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**
Initializing the memory bank and addressing specific code corrections.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created `projectbrief.md` with project name, core requirements, and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` detailing the project's purpose, problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.
- Modified `apps/orka-app/src/pages/AppUsersPage.tsx` with new additions.

**Next Steps:**
- Create `systemPatterns.md` to document system architecture and key technical decisions.
- Create `techContext.md` to outline technologies, development setup, and dependencies.
- Create `progress.md` to track the project's status, remaining work, and known issues.
- Correct the implementation of `IOrkaClient` in `OrkaClientImpl`.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Ensuring all memory bank files are structured clearly and contain relevant information for future reference.
- Maintaining consistency in documentation style.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
- The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context across sessions, especially given the reset characteristic. Precision in documentation is key.
