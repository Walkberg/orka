# Progress

**What Works:**
- The project structure is set up as a monorepo using Nx.
- Core backend services are being developed with NestJS.
- Frontend applications are being built with React and Vite.
- Shared libraries for React components and UI elements are in place.
- Database interactions are managed via Prisma.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Implementation of user authentication and authorization flows.
- Development of core features for application and organization management.
- Integration of frontend and backend services.
- Comprehensive testing and deployment strategies.

**Current Status:**
- Initial setup and foundational documentation (memory bank) are in progress.
- Development of core modules for authentication, organization, and application management is underway.

**Known Issues:**
- None at this stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- The decision to use a monorepo with Nx and pnpm has been made to streamline development and dependency management.
- The adoption of DDD principles in the backend structure is guiding module development.
